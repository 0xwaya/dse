              Waya Labs is a research and development Hub focus on blockchain innovation
              to drive mass adoption by building a Digital Sovereign Ecosystem (DSE) by
              integrating distributed web3 protocols to create a censorship resistance
              ecosystem for our community.
            </p>

            <p>
              Researching and testing creative and successful smart contract use cases are
              key to identify what works and what could be improved. allowing new solutions
              and utilities to emerge in a constant testing and development of new ways to
              participate in the blockchain revolution.
            </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Our distributed applications will be designed with multiple insentive
                  based protocols such as work to earn for team members, learn to earn to attract
                  new users, and participate to earn to reward our community members and NFT holders
                  with access to special incubator presale allocations and a weekly lottery for
                  hodlers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To ensure digital sovereignty it is necessary for each element of Waya Labs
                  ecosystem to operate as a distributed web3 protocol to minimize the risks
                  of a single point of failure. the initial versions might hace some centralized
                  web3 protocols temporarily, each new version will integrate decentralized interoperability
                  to replace previous centralized funtions.

              <p>
                Ethereum has proven to be the leading blockchain platform to develop
                smart contracts, althought transaction fees remain high it is without
                a doubt the leader, altough some emerging chains are stablishing as
                some sustainable alternatives considering energy consumption, security
                and scalability abilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Research of scalability problems in emerging Layer.1 protocols were
                key to identifying the blockchain we’ve chosen to build on.

            <p>
              <b>Scalability:</b> designed to be massively scalable. Tri-chain structure
              with the core consensus engine is able to support a global network
              of potentially hundreds of millions of internet-connected, low latencies
              and very high transactions per second.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Security:</b> designed with robust high security. Avalanche provides a very
              strong guarantee of safety when the attacker is below a certain threshold,
              which can be parametrized by the system designer; it provides graceful
              degradation when the attacker exceeds this threshold. It can uphold safety
              guarantees even when the attacker exceeds 80%. It is the ﬁrst permission-less
              system to exceeds 51% attack safety threshold using the*SNOW consensus.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Decentralization:</b> commitment to multiple client implementations and no
              centralized control of any kind. The ecosystem is designed to avoid
              divisions between classes of users with different interests. Most importantly
              there is no distinction between miners, developers, and users, allowing
              private or public subnets to be created in a compatible environment with any
              programming language, each subnet then becomes a validator, and can also host
              it's own blockchain design and decentralized network.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Governance:</b> Avalanche is an inclusive platform, which enables anyone to
              connect to its network and participate in validation and governance. Any
              token holder can have a vote in selecting key ﬁnancial parameters and in
              choosing how the system evolves.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Interoperability:</b> designed to be a universal and ﬂexible infrastructure
              for a multitude of blockchains/assets, where the base $AVAX is used for security
              and as a unit of account for exchange. The Avalanche C-chain is a EVM dedicated
              for Smart contracts and dApp environments.

              You can access C-Chain through MetaMask, by defining a custom network.
              Go to MetaMask, log in, click the network dropdown, and select 'Custom RPC'.
              Data for Avalanche is as follows.

            <p>
              To add the network to MetaMask, we need to call the wallet_addEthereumChain method,
              exposed by the web3 provider.
            </p>
              <code> 
                function addAvalancheNetwork() {
                injected.getProvider().then(provider => {
                provider
                .request({
                method: 'wallet_addEthereumChain',
                params: [AVALANCHE_MAINNET_PARAMS]
                })
                .catch((error: any) => {
                console.log(error)
                })
                })
                }
              </code>
            <p>
              Where injected is initialized as a web3-react/injected-connector used to
              interface with MetaMask APIs. Usage for other popular web frameworks is similar.
            </p>    
             <h3>
               To add the test network replace:
             </h3> 
               <code>
                  AVALANCHE_MAINNET_PARAMS with AVALANCHE_TESTNET_PARAMS
               </code>
            <p>
              Typical usage pattern would be to expose a button calling that method if you get
              Wrong Network or Error connecting errors when attempting to establish a connection
              to MetaMask.
