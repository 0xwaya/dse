         </li>
        <ul>
          Finding a way for automated time-stamping, without any reliance on the characteristics of the medium on which the data appears, so that it is impossible to change even one bit of the document, tt should be impossible to stamp a document with a time and date different from the actual one.

          "...To implement transferable global rights, enforced entirely by protocol, to names, attributions, bit gold, and similar purely informatic property owned by a particular entity but possessed and relied upon by the public, and how to implement a secure title database for other kinds of property. For a particular example of cross-trust-boundary rights enforced entirely by protocol, see my proposal for name integrity in cross-trust-boundary file systems.

         </li>
        <ul>
          "Smart contracts go beyond the vending machine in proposing to embed contracts in all sorts of property that is valuable and controlled by digital means. Smart contracts reference that property in a dynamic, often proactively enforced form, and provide much better observation and verification where proactive measures must fall short."

          "A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending."

          "Ethereum intends to provide a blockchain with a built-in fully fledged Turing-complete programming language that can be used to create "contracts" that can be used to encode arbitrary state transition functions, allowing users to create any of the systems described above, as well as many others that we have not yet imagined, simply by writing up the logic in a few lines of code."

          "A lot of people automatically dismiss e-currency as a lost cause because of all the companies that failed since the 1990’s. I hope it’s obvious it was only the centrally controlled nature of those systems that doomed them. I think this is the first time we’re trying a decentralized, non-trust-based system."
